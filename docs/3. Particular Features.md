## Creating Moving Platforms
To create a Moving Platform, you must first create the hierarchy it requires.  
Create the SimGroup that will contain the Moving Platform and the Path.

Now you can rename this SimGroup as you wish. Then create the Path object.

Drag the Path object that you just created into the SimGroup that you created earlier.

Now select the Path object and build the path by using the "Edit Mode" button.

Now right click the SimGroup and create a "PathedInterior".  
Navigate to the .dif file containing the interior you want to use.  
Drag the PathedInterior back inside the SimGroup if it was created outside of it.
